        This product app is built with **Next.js** because my resume already highlights my experience with React.js.  
        so I wanted to prove my ability to take new chanllenges. Next.js allows me to improve **performance, SEO, and server-side rendering (SSR)**, making the app faster and more efficient.
      </p>

      <p className="about-paragraph">
        The app helps users **browse and discover products easily**. It includes smooth **animations** when adding or removing items  
        from the cart and when opening product details, making the experience more engaging.

        Since Bun doesn't fully support Next.js's default **Image** component, I built a **custom Image component**  
        that provides **a fallback for missing images** and adapts its size and style based on usage.

      <p className="about-paragraph">
        For accessibility, I avoided using `.stopPropagation()` or `.preventDefault()` in the cart icon inside product cards.  
        This ensures better support for **screen readers and keyboard navigation**, following **WCAG** best practices.

      <p className="about-paragraph">
        API calls are handled separately to **leverage SSR** and improve performance. I also avoided using `"use client"`  
        in several pages where it wasnâ€™t needed to keep rendering efficient.
